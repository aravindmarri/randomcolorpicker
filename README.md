## Description

My project is about picking a random number and displaying its RGB code and Hex code of that randomly picked value and display that code color as well.
Below you can find some sample images of this project.
In my project, I follow the material design and material fundamentals.

Here I imported the npm package for the color pick manually in a popup. This code will help with the installation of the color picker package : npm install ngx-color-picker --save
